I am a **Solution Architect** with experience on projects in Telco, Finance and Utilities and with previous experience on several technological contexts and in different roles and tasks (programmer, analyst, team leader, project manager, test manager, business and functional analyst).

I have achieved good communication and interpersonal skills, as in addition to excellent ability to analyze and understand the requirements expressed by the business. 
These skills, together with the technical expertise gained through the years, allow me to have the overview necessary for the design of the most appropriate technological solutions for the specific project context.

Passionate about innovation and technology, I like to read, study and experiment with new ideas on new projects.

I play **guitar**, I like **photography**, I love **nature** and **bike rides**.
